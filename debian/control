Description: Window Maker dockapp that displays the time and date
 WMTime displays the time and date and gives you some nice additional 
 features too.  It is intended for docking in Window Maker.
 .
 It currently provides:
 .
   * the time and date;
   * a realtime morphing interface (analog <> digital mode);
   * auto-scaled and anti-aliased hands;
   * localization: displaying the day and date in various languages;
   * three user-defined commands to launch.
