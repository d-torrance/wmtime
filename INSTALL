Installation instructions for WMTime.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing particular, but a computer might come in handy doh ;-)


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1)  % make
2)  % make install (as root)

3)* WMTime uses month and weekday abbreviations from the
    currently set locale.  If these abbreviations do not
    use Latin alphabet characters, then WMTime defaults to
    US/English.

    You may change this behavior by using the '-l' command line
    option, e.g.,

    % wmtime -l es_MX.utf8

Be sure to read the HINTS and TODO files too!
