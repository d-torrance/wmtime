TODO list for WMTime.
--------------------------------------------------------------
	* Optional LCD GUI, either compiletime or runtime;
	* Alarmclock function with sound support, note that
	  the 'empty space' in -digital is reserved for the
	  alarm settings buttons, gadgets etc.;
	* Dualmode time display (analog mode with transparent
	  digital clock that shines through);
	* Simple crontab job launcher/setter?;

Your feedback! If you have nice suggestions, ideas, whatever,
that aren't on this list, feel free to mail them to:

	wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org

If you don't let us know... how are we suppose to know? ;-)
